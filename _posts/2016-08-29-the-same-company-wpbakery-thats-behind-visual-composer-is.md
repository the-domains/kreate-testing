What's even better, with this addon you wil be able to import and export your created templates to use them on other sites!

The basic explanation for the use of this plugin is this: let's imagine that you have built a new VC block that's meant for collecting users information; their name, their address, email address, and other details, and then you decide to use this block across multiple pages on your site. In this case, instead of having to edit the block separately for each page, you can use Templatera to edit one template and have the changes appear across all pages. A feature worth having, and worth investing into as it will increase productivity, and save a ton of time.
